# CrabStitch
This is a Tauri and Rust based port of original SmartStitch by MechTechnology.
It was merely developed to test capabilities of Gemini 3 Pro. I had no intentions of maintaining yet another stitching tool.
But since it worked pretty well, I have decided to put it on github and release compiled installers for all major platforms.
This way, even people using MacOS or Linux will also enjoy download and run experience instead of installing python.

## Advantages
- Upto 60% reduction in RAM usage
- Upto 70% reduction in time taken to stitch same amount of pages
- Results identical to original SmartStitch

## Disadvantages
- AI generated code.
- No intentions of adding any more features (PRs are welcome)
- Rust code so has some learning curve for interested maintainers

### My thoughts
Even though this is an AI generated application, I don't know about LICENSE and stuff to use.
I'll just advice to not use this in actual professional work.
